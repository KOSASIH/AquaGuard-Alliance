# AquaGuard Alliance System Architecture

## Overview

The AquaGuard Alliance system is designed to integrate blockchain technology, IoT devices, and a user-friendly web application to facilitate marine conservation and community engagement. The architecture is modular, allowing for scalability and easy integration of new features.

## Components

### 1. Frontend

- **Technology**: React.js / Vue.js
- **Description**: The frontend application provides an interactive user interface for community members and fishermen. It allows users to monitor coral reef health, access educational resources, and participate in the fishermen welfare program.

### 2. Backend

- **Technology**: Node.js / Express.js
- **Description**: The backend server handles API requests, manages user authentication, and interacts with the database and blockchain. It serves as the intermediary between the frontend and the data sources.

### 3. Blockchain Layer

- **Technology**: Ethereum / Hyperledger
- **Description**: The blockchain layer is responsible for managing smart contracts, ensuring transparency in transactions, and maintaining a decentralized ledger for the fishermen welfare program and conservation incentives.

### 4. IoT Layer

- **Technology**: MQTT / WebSocket
- **Description**: The IoT layer consists of various sensors and drones that collect real-time data on coral reef health and marine life. This data is transmitted to the backend for processing and analysis.

### 5. Database

- **Technology**: MongoDB / PostgreSQL
- **Description**: The database stores user information, transaction records, and historical data on coral reef health. It is designed for scalability and quick retrieval of data.

## Data Flow

1. **Data Collection**: IoT devices collect data on marine conditions and send it to the backend.
2. **Data Processing**: The backend processes the incoming data and stores it in the database.
3. **User  Interaction**: Users interact with the frontend to view data, participate in programs, and access resources.
4. **Blockchain Transactions**: Smart contracts are executed for transactions related to the fishermen welfare program and conservation efforts.

## Conclusion

The AquaGuard Alliance architecture is designed to be robust, scalable, and user-friendly, ensuring that all stakeholders can effectively engage in marine conservation efforts.
